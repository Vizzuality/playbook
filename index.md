# Vizzuality Guidelines

The â€œVizzuality Guidelines" include the information and agreed practices that govern our work at Vizzuality. The purpose of this methodology is two-fold. First, for new staff this should provide the knowledge required to understand how things work here. For existing staff this serves as a reference when you need guidance or when making a decision.
