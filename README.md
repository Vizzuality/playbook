## Welcome to Vizzuality's Guidelines

### If you want to propose new guidelines or amend existing ones keep in mind:

- Guideline creation and amendment is done trough Consent (to-do: add a link to consent process here)
- Seek advice (to-do: link to advice process here) before creating or amending guidelines. Guidelines are the result of a teamwork and as such, team-led guideline creation is encouraged
- Perform a due diligence to understand context and background around the issue (has this been discussed before, is there a _de facto_ practice already in place, are there conflicting views about the matter?)
- Even if a guideline has a scope (office, functional team...) the whole team can participate in the consent process.
- The person/s who propose the guideline creation/edition are responsible for moving the process forward.
- Whenever possible try to keep the current high-level structure. Create new sections or subsections only when necessary.
- Keep things as simple as possible, only write new guidelines when they are needed.
- Write in clear, specific and actionable terms. Guidelines are decision helpers, not judgments or theoretical statements.
- For new guidelines, make sure the guideline you are adding doesn't already exist.
- For existing ones, make sure you review the history of changes to see if the issue you propose to amend has already been discussed before.


### To create or amend a guideline you can start a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Keep in mind:

- Start your PR with a short and meaningful title (e.g. "Guideline for hiring process")
- Explain in a couple paragraphs the motivation for the guideline creation/amendment and the context and background
- The created/amended text of the guideline should also be added to the PR text for easier reading.

TBD:
- Add as assignees the team of people who are leading this guideline creation, including yourself (a team can be formed at this step too)
- Add as reviewers the people you think should be involved by giving advice, or because they are directly affected TBD: should we create teams according to scopes?). Remember, though that anyone can participate
- Announce the new guideline creation/amendment process on Slack (TBD: where?)

### When participating in a Guideline discussion process:

- Please follow the Consent process
- Use the keywords "Agree", "Disagree", "Object" explaining clearly afterward the reasons
- Use the keyword "Proposed changes" to suggest amendments, corrections or additions
- Try not to make judgments, base your opinions on facts or rational reasons rather than judgments or emotions
- Use Non-Violent Communication (to-do: link to NVC guidelines here)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
