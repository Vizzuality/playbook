## Welcome to Vizzuality's Guidelines

### What is a guideline?

A guideline is a written statement that helps make autonomous decisions.

### Where can I find guidelines?

All guidelines are stored in this repository. You can find them either by using keyword search or navigating the categories.

### What if I cannot find a guideline?

You need to follow the *advice process* to arrive at a decision. Anyone in the advice process can initiate a process to create a guideline based on the advice.

### What if the guideline exists but I don't want to follow it?

You need to follow the **advice process** to arrive at a decision. Anyone in the advice process can initiate a process to amend the guideline based on the advice.

### How are guidelines created / amended?

Guideline creation and amendment is done through **consent process** (to-do: add a link to consent process here), as a result of the advice process. The person/s who propose the guideline creation / amendment are responsible for moving the process forward. Team-led guideline creation is encouraged. Even if a guideline has a scope (company, office, functional team, project team) the whole team can participate in the consent process.

### How to write a good guideline?

- For new guidelines, make sure the guideline you are adding doesn't already exist.
- For existing ones, make sure you review the history of changes to see if the issue you propose to amend has already been discussed before.
- Perform due diligence to understand context and background around the issue (has this been discussed before, is there a *de facto* practice already in place, are there conflicting views about the matter?)
- Whenever possible try to keep the current high-level structure. Create new sections or subsections only when necessary.
- Keep things as simple as possible, only write new guidelines when they are needed.
- Write in clear, specific and actionable terms. Guidelines are decision helpers, not judgments or theoretical statements.

### To create or amend a guideline you can start a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Keep in mind:

- Start your PR with a short and meaningful title (e.g. "Guideline for hiring process")
- Explain in a couple paragraphs the motivation for the guideline creation/amendment and the context and background
- The created/amended text of the guideline should also be added to the PR text for easier reading.

TBD:
- Add as assignees the team of people who are leading this guideline creation, including yourself (a team can be formed at this step too)
- Add as reviewers the people you think should be involved by giving advice, or because they are directly affected TBD: should we create teams according to scopes?). Remember, though that anyone can participate
- Announce the new guideline creation/amendment process on Slack (TBD: where?)

### When participating in a Guideline discussion process:

- Please follow the Consent process
- Use the keywords "Agree", "Disagree", "Object" explaining clearly afterward the reasons
- Use the keyword "Proposed changes" to suggest amendments, corrections or additions
- Try not to make judgments, base your opinions on facts or rational reasons rather than judgments or emotions
- Use Non-Violent Communication (to-do: link to NVC guidelines here)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Vizzuality/playbook/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
