## Welcome to Vizzuality's Guidelines

### What is a guideline?

A guideline is a written statement that helps make autonomous decisions.

### Where can I find guidelines?

All guidelines are stored in this repository. You can find them either by using keyword search or navigating the categories.

### What if I cannot find a guideline?

You need to follow the **advice process** to arrive at a decision. Anyone in the advice process can initiate a consent process to create a guideline based on the advice.

### What if the guideline exists but it is not sufficient?

Sometimes you may discover that an existing guideline does not cover your specific case, is out of sync with current best practice or contradicts other guidelines. In such case you don't have to follow it, but you need to follow the **advice process** to arrive at a decision. Anyone in the advice process can initiate a consent process to amend the guideline.

### When not to create guidelines?

It's important to reflect on your motivation for proposing a new guideline. The goal with guidance is to have only that which is necessary to make the company run smoothly and well. It should not be in reaction to bad behaviour or one-off situation. Assess whether feedback or conflict resolution might be a more appropriate means of dealing with it.

### How are guidelines created / amended?

Guideline creation and amendment is done through **consent process** (to-do: add a link to consent process here), as a result of the advice process. The person/s who propose the guideline creation / amendment are responsible for moving the process forward. Team-led guideline creation is encouraged. Even if a guideline has a scope (company, office, functional team, project team) the whole team can participate in the consent process.

### How to write a good guideline?

- For new guidelines, make sure the guideline you are adding doesn't already exist.
- For existing ones, make sure you review the history of changes to see if the issue you propose to amend has already been discussed before.
- Perform due diligence to understand context and background around the issue (has this been discussed before, is there a *de facto* practice already in place, are there conflicting views about the matter?)
- Whenever possible try to keep the current high-level structure. Create new sections or subsections only when necessary.
- Keep things as simple as possible, only write new guidelines when they are needed.
- Write in clear, specific and actionable terms. Guidelines are decision helpers, not judgments or theoretical statements.

### To create or amend a guideline you can start a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). Keep in mind:

- Start your PR with a short and meaningful title (e.g. "Guideline for hiring process").
- Briefly explain the motivation for the guideline creation/amendment and the context and background.
- The created / amended text of the guideline should also be added to the PR text for easier reading.
- Add as assignees the people who are leading this guideline creation, including yourself.
- Add as reviewers the people who should be involved by giving advice, or who are directly affected. Remember that anyone can participate.
- Announce the new guideline creation / amendment process on #general channel in Slack.
- Allow up to 3 days for comments.
- Announce the outcome on #general channel in Slack.

### When participating in a Guideline discussion process:

- Please follow the Consent process. In that process a decision does not require everybody to agree, it only requires that nobody raises a meaningful objection.
- Use the reactions :+1: "Agree", :confused: "Disagree", :-1: "Object" and explain clearly afterward your reasons.
- Use the keyword "Proposed changes" to suggest amendments, corrections or additions.
- If you want to propose a bigger change, edit the file directly and include a link to the diff in the comment box. You can also paste the new wording in the comment box.
- If you were assigned as a [reviewer of a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/), you have additional tools available to comment on particular sections of the text, approve or request changes. 
- Try not to make judgments. Base your opinions on facts or rational reasons rather than judgments or emotions.
- Use [Non-Violent Communication](https://vizzuality.github.io/playbook/conflict-resolution/).
- Provide your comments in a timely manner, normally up to 3 days.
