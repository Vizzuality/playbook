Feedback is about helping you grow… not about correcting you
Feedback at Vizzuality is not about changing or correcting someone or being right about something. It is a conversation with an honest intent or purpose to contribute either generally to someone’s development, or more specifically by highlighting something that’s standing in the way of their objective or something they’re striving for. In this sense, you are giving the feedback for the other person’s sake.
