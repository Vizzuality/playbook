# Feedback Loops Roadmap

### Next Steps / Timeline

- Build concrete guidline doc
- Outline general rules for framing the system (frequency, who-who, how, central axioms)
- General framework for different interactions
- Champions/Ambassadors
- Scaffold behaviour (Phase 2)

### Open/Unanswered Questions

Things that need to be discussed moving forwards. See the [open-questions document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eGlzH5fOxIchVyLRipWBrNBIgdQ18-BHVmVD-PnEmoI/edit#heading=h.aqcfnjgggoxb) to keep up-to-date.

Areas/Contexts that have not been addressed:

1. Replacing/Augmenting Performance Reviews

    At this stage have addressed formative (ongoing) feedback, but we are lacking a solution to summative (end of line) feedback, mainly in the context of formal reviews.

2. Knowledge Sharing

    Teaching eachother. Not getting bogged down in problems that others have solved.

3. Retrospectives

    Creating guidlines for retrospectives. What have we learned? What can be done better? If we do this it also lends well to feedforward processes...

4. Feedforward

    How do we set ourselves up in kick-offs so that we work with more efficiency? Should we have a guideline for documenting the things learned?

5. Automated Feedback

    Using testing as a means of feedback for devs.
