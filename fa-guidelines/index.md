## Project Managers

### Project Managers' Guide

In the documentlinked below we intend to establish a common work methodology for project management. The phases and elements listed here are the result of the combination of tools each PM uses. The goal is to optimize the way we work and standardize the procedures as much as possible so that every person is familiar with it, even across functional teams. This document also intends to centralize all relevant templates and guidelines. Thus, hyperlinks to those documents are highlighted whenever it applies.
