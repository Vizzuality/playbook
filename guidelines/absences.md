# Absences

Everyone affected by your absence needs to be able to easily understand your and others' availability. This is done by using tools which allow to record and access this information in one place.

The company-wide tool for requesting absences is Bamboo. Aim to give as much notice for your absence as you reasonably can, as a rule of thumb: two weeks if you're away for less than two weeks, a month if longer.

Currently we don't have a company-wide standard of recording limited availability due to travel, participation in workshops or events. However, there exist the following approaches adopted by some teams, which you should get acquainted with and use when working with that team:

## Bamboo "unavailable" option

If you are going to be working but mostly unavailable because you are travelling, in a client sprint or in a conference, please use the "unavailable" option in Bamboo to set those dates in advance. The process is the same as with time off requests.

## Teamweek

Record time-off using the "holiday" project and create projects for events you're taking part in. This is visible in the timeline in the same way as your project assignments.
