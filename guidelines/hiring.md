# Hiring guidelines
Bringing new people to the team is one of the most important processes for us. It helps us achieve our strategic priorities and ultimately brings us closer to our vision and purpose. Hiring is a big decision that affects resources and shapes the company we want to work at. A new hire is not just a set of capacities and skills, it is a person with whom we will spend many hours working hand by hand, who will hopefully develop personally and professionally with us and from whom we can learn.

A good (or bad) hiring decision affects us all and we believe the process should be as collective, open and transparent as possible.

This document oultlines the general processes, tools and guidelines we use in a hiring process, and assumes the decision to hire someone has already been taken and the resources allocated. The process for deciding when to open a position is not covered here.
## Writing a Job Description
Job descriptions should be based on the evaluation of the role we are looking for, its key responsibility areas and the competencies, and the characteristics we value in all team members, such as:

- Aligned to our purpose and vision.
- Proactive and constructive. 
- Results oriented, pragmatic.
- Positive and upbeat
- Team player
- Responsive
- Honest and generous

A WIP document with Vizzuality’s core competencies can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uiOxd-rfeltZbGxP1yAe6_ZxPvup3o1JzCCQ-FTjNHc/edit These are competencies that we expect from all team members at diferent levels, regardless of their role.

Specific roles have additional competencies, mostly technical, but they could also be about leadership or communication depending on the role. Before hiring for a role we should take time to define such competencies. An exampe for a front end engineer can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WcZyJNBfF6VmwE9uAYZe3A23lleoEhtWKB7QIEZW2nA/edit

A job description should generally contain:

- A clear and straightforward description of the job opening: _We are looking for a front-end engineer to join our team on a full-time contract in our office in Madrid or Porto._

- A brief description of Vizzuality that also includes our values, vision and purpose

- An explanation of our general motivation and expectations around our new peer.

- A descriptive text about the role, its importance for us, our projects and our purpose as a company.

- A list of key responsibility areas and daily tasks (_Advanced JavaScript programming of innovative interfaces and large client-side applications. Configuration and optimization of client-side libraries and frameworks…_), and also additional sporadic or possible responsibilities (_Assisting in proposals, Representing us in talks and conferences…_)

- A list of expected skills and competencies, including the desired level of each (Proficiency, experience, knowledge, familiarity…). These should be also stated as must or nice to have if that’s the case.

- Any mandatory or disqualifying criteria like english level, visa status, academic level (if they exist.

- [TBD] A note about diversity and equal opportunity

- Clear instructions on how to apply, and mandatoru info (CV, cover letter, code samples, document formats, etc)

When writing a job description we should always check our text for gender or racial bias, and avoid clichés such as “superstar”, “champion” or “hero”. The whole text should permeate our values, purpose and core competencies. 

We sometimes use automatic tools to check the text for gender bias (link to tool here), but in general it’s always good to have a few people read it to refine and spot possible issues.

## Posting the Job ad

Once the description has been written and reviewed we use BambooHR to publish it and manage the selection process. When creating a selection process there’s a few options to fill in, such as title, description, contract type or location. Please provide a BambooHR admin with this info to post the ad.

There’s also the possibility to add required or optional application questions such as CV, cover letter, link to personal website, LinkedIn or GitHub account, available date, etc Custom questions can also be added.

After creting the add, collaborators can be assigned to open positions. Collaborators will have access to all the application data (except for private fields such as desired salary) and ability to score, comment or contact applicants
Promoting the ad

Open positions are published at https://vizzuality.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/ and automatically posted to certain free listings such as glassdoor and indeed.

Wen a new position is published you should also talk to @camellia about promoting it in our social networks, and post in #general so other team members can do it in theirs.

Depending on the urgency or availability we sometimes use paid services like LinkedIn recruiter. These have a cost per impressions and should be monitored if set up. Speak to DG if you think the process needs it

Additionally there are other resources that can be used:

### For developers

Betabeers (spain only, 50 € per announcement)

###For Designers
Domestika (free?)
### For Data Scientists
Others?
## Selection Process
Once the post is live, collaborators will receive email updates about new candidates, coments or status changes. They are expected to regularly check new candidates, rank them and post comments about them. A slack channel (eg #front-end-hiring) can also be created to make this process easier.


### First filter
A first screening can be done at this pont where any of the collaborators can suggest to discard a candiadte as “not a fit”, “not qualified” or “over qualified”. The decision to discard a candidate should be made by consent, meaning if there’s no principled objections the candidate can be discarded.

### Review
Candidates who pass the first filter can either be marked as “reviewed” or “put on hold”. The chice is basically about priority

if the candidate looks promissing but there’s any more info needed (code samples, certifications, visa status, motivations, etc) then collaborators can send an email through the system requesting it (there are available templates on BambooHR for this) and change the status to “Requested more info.

Once a satisfactory response has been received applicant can be moved to “reviewed” or “put on hold”
### Phone screen
Collaborators should regularly check for “reviewed” candidates and schedule a first phone screen (emailing the candidate and changing status to “Scheduled Phone Screen”. This is a short introductory call where we try to solve doubts and get a better sense of the candidate and their fit.

Ideally phone screen should be prerformed by at least two people, one of which should be in a functional role that is similar to the open position. Ther should be a brief preparation beforehand prioritizing the items to focus on. 

TBD Ideally at least a part of th phone screen should be counducted in English

We have a template (WIP) with possible questions for these calls. In general they should be open and focus on the competencies, skills and cultural fit of the candidate, but remember this is not an interview, so should also be kept short.

Apart from other specific issues (such as availability, english language, etc) we should focus on the candidate’s motivation and offer to solve any doubts they may have about the position or the company.

A brief minute of the call should be documented in the “comments” section
### Challenge
Some times we may request a skill challenge to the candidates. ---> link to code challenges (TBD create challenges for other roles?)

We should explain clearly what we expect from the challenge, how much effort we think the candidate should put on it, the general rules and what we will be trying to learn from it.

Once the challenge solution is received collaborators should do a round of discussion around it, evaluate it and ask for clarifications if needed.

Candidates can then be discarded, put on hold or move to the next step in the process by consent. In all cases candidates should be contacted and informed
### Interview
Sucessful candidates are set for an interview. Interviews, when possible, should be presential. If it’s hard to make it in person then we should make sure we have a proper set-up with cameras, a quiet environment and a good microphone. We shoul also set aside enough time for preparing and conducting the interview.

Ideally there should be at least two people in a similar role and with equal or higher seniority, plus other relevant roles in the interview. In the preparation we will try to converge on the most important topics to talk about and the things we want to learn/clarify

We should have a rough script of the questions we want to ask and what we want to assess with them, focusing on competencies and skills. We should also document responses and impressions in a way other people who weren’t there can understand them

Before the interview we should have shared with the candidate our ideas around their level (junior, mid senior and a doc with the competencies and skils (additional to those listed in the job description)

TBD Ideally at least a part of th interview should be counducted in English


A rough outline of the interview could go like this:

- Present everyone in the room, who you are, what you do, etc
- Tell the candidate about our general impression and why we think they are a fit (so far) Tell them also about what we want to get from this interview, and explain the process from here
- Tell the candidate we will be taking notes that may be shared with othere in the team, and ask if that’s ok
- Listen to the candidates motivation to join us, expectations, reasons to change, background, etc. 
- Ask if they want any clarifications about the role or the company
- Converge on expectations. Explain what we expect from the role, discuss our level evaluation and explain salary tiers. Explain benefits
- Ask open questions about different topics [WIP create template with open questions]
- Explain next steps and wrap up

After the interview the minutes and impressions are posted to the comments section, and candiate is set as “Interviewed” or discarded using consent, in which case candidate should be informed.
### Final decision
When there’s one or more sucessful interviewed candidates we have a number of options, all by consent:

- Choose one of them and make an offer 
- Request another interview to untie or clarify (ideally including people who weren’t in the first)
- Wait for more suitable candidates before making a decision

In principle there’s not a limit to the number of interviews, but we should also be conscious of the candidate’s time and availability. 

Whatever the case the candidate should be contacted an informed

If there’s a consent to hire a candidate we should send a formal offer. This is legaly binding, so in principle it should be signed by someone in the exec team.

If the candidate accepts the offer a pre-contract is signed and all the remaining candidates are informed.

If there’s a negotiation or the offer is rejected, the selection process continues as normal.
