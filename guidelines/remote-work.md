# Company Wide Remote Guidelines

Vizzuality is remote friendly, staff can work remotely from a different city or work from the Madrid, Cambridge or Porto office but sporadically spend mornings/afternoons/days remote. 

Employees who are fully remote will normally be required to spend some initial time (between 3 and 6 months) in one of the offices to get to know the team.

Because of the different locations and the flexibility in our working hours we have a few practices to help the team know who is available when, and where.

### For all the team

It's a good practice to use the active/away status on Slack to let others know when you are working. It's also a good practice to check in & out on the general channel to let people know when you start and finish your day (also nice to say Hello and Goodbye to peers).

If you work regularly the same hours everyday, enable working hours in the Google Calendar under `Settings > General > Working hours` to let people know what times you're working and when you're available for meetings. This will warn people if they try to invite you to a meeting outside of these hours.

If you are going to be working but mostly unavailable because you are traveling, in a client sprint or in a conference, please use the "unavailable" option in Bamboo to set those dates in advance. The process is the same as with time off requests.

### For sporadic remote work

If you will be sporadically remote it's a good idea to let your closer team know in advance, in case there was anything planned that requires your presence.

When you are working remote please update your Slack status (using the house icon or a foreign flag based on the country you're in):

If you are abroad, update your Time Zone in `Profile & account > Edit Profile > Time Zone` so other people know which is your current time. Alternatively, you can just click on your name on any of your messages and click on _Edit your profile_.
