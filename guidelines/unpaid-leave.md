# Voluntary unpaid leave

### What is it
It is a period that the worker can ask the company during which the employment contract is suspended and neither the worker has the obligation to go to his position, nor the company has the obligation to pay the salary or to quote for the worker.

While the unpaid leave is in force, the employment contract is not broken but remains in force.

The voluntary leave does not imply a right to the reservation of the job, that means that in the end, you do not have the right to return to the same position you had before. There is only one right of preferential re-entry in an equal or similar category.
You have the right to return to the company only if there is a position, and this position can be equal to what you had before the leave or a similar category.

Although there is no right to reserve the position, this right can be freely agreed between the company and the worker.

### Who can ask for it
Anyone who has been in the company for at least 1 year may request the unpaid leave and has not requested another leave of absence in the previous 4 years.

### How long could it be
Voluntary leave can last between 4 months and 5 years.

In the case that we have requested leave for a period less than the maximum (1 year, for example) and need a few months, you can request the extension or successive extensions provided without exceeding the limit of 5 years.

### The applicant
The applicant can request it for any reason, without having to explain it to the company, provided that it does not breach the good faith or a pact or clause of the contract.
Will be very appreciated the main reason of it to learn and improve ourselves.

### The company
Compulsory to grant for the company if the applicant meets the requirements

### During it
The applicant can dedicate himself to whatever he wants always when he does not breach the good faith or a pact or clause of the contract.

### How to
1. The interested send the request in writing at least 1 month in advance with:
    - Full Name
    - Company
    - Date of the request
    - Start day
    - End day.

  Or just full fill this [Template here]

  Also very appreciated to notify before this timeframe.
1. The company responds in [to define some time] writing to the request and agree with the requester how to pay the pending vacation, extra payments, or other amounts that are entitled.

### Coming back
To be able to return to the company it is necessary that the interested makes the request, since even if the date has been reached, the re-entry is not automatic.

- The applicant will have to request it in writing.
- The company has 3 options:
   - It accepts the request and offers the worker re-entry in a position of the same or similar category.
   - It doesn't accept the application but doesn't deny the re-entry: it would be the case that the company indicates that it currently doesn't have any available place of an equal or similar category, so it can not reinstate the worker for now.
   - It doesn't accept the request and denies the re-entry: the refusal to be back must be clear. It is understood as finished the employment relationship and the worker may sue the company for dismissal.

### What if
- Does the interested want to go back before?
  - Until the leave does not end, you do not have the right to return to the company so the worker can't request re-entry before the requested time of leave is fulfilled.
   - In case of wanting to do it, the worker and the company can agree to finish and re-entry. But the company is not obliged to accept it.
- Does not request reinstatement:
  - If after exceeding the legal limits set for the duration or the date indicated, the employee does not request the re-entry,  the right of preference will be lost.
- The company does not respond:
  - It is understood as a denial of the employment relationship. In this case, the employee could file a dismissal complaint.
- The company denies reinstatement
  - It the same than a dismissal, with all the consequences and effects related to the payment of the corresponding severance payments and liquidations of assets pending payment.
