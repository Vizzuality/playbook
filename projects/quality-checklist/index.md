# Quality checklist
We want a minimum check to be applied to different aspects of the project to ensure that the end-product meet our high standards. We have identified several key criteria to check in four broad areas of a project's life cycle. 

## Research
TODO

## Data
TODO

## Design
- [ ] The researcher reviewed the wireframes/design and gave them a green-light [  ]
- [ ] The developer reviewed the design deliverables before starting implementation
	- UI Kit, Icons (Icomoon), Compressed Images, Interactions...
- [ ] The designer reviewed the implementation and gave it a green-light
- [ ] The designer had big enough / uninterrupted chunks of time to focus on the project
	- Can we create a hard rule? 1 week 1 project?
	- Can development support / meetings happen in fixes hour of the day?
- [ ] Presentations included explanations
+ Add other project-specific quality checks when needed
