#**Retrospectives.**

#Thinking back to do better

This document aims to be a set of guidelines, do’s and don’ts for us to follow and be best aligned in how we run retrospectives. 

##Purpose.
Looking back is always a good way to learn and improve from our experience. 
The main objective of a retrospective is to improve the way we work together, but below there is a list of more outcomes you can get. 

##Outcome from a Retrospective.
- Review our processes.
- Detect areas of improvement.
- Detect issues in the project to solve them before they go wild. 
- Detect good things we want to keep.
- Align team members. 
- Identify new opportunities for future phases.

##When should you do a retrospective?
We don’t need to reach the end of the project or come to a place where people seem to be detached from the project to run a retrospective. 
Run a retrospective: 
- At the end of the project. Wait some days after the release but don’t postpone it too long. A week after the release seems like good timing. 
- When a milestone has been accomplished. Such as when an ongoing project has had a clear release, or at the end of the quarter / six months...
- You feel things are not working the best they could while we are working on the project. 

#Process for a Retrospective.
There are millions of ways to run a retrospective. Below is a procedure we have tested many times in different situations but you can adapt as needed. 
Here you have some general ideas you might want to take into account: 

Prepare the session in advance. Look for a quiet and private space. Be sure you have the tools you need and people know what this is about so they can get ready for it. If there are people joining remotely, think about the technology you need. 

Ask someone to be the facilitator. That person will make sure everybody talks and express their ideas. Also, they will take notes during the session and will develop the conclusions document. The facilitator can be someone in the team or a special guest but in any case, that person will need background information about the project to better follow the conversation. Ideally they would not have worked directly on the project, so they can provide an outside perspective.

Make sure everybody knows the subject and the objectives of the session. You can send an email beforehand and always go through them at the beginning of the session. 

Make sure to be positive in communicating. It’s about sharing what we could improve next time, in positive way we can learn from. It is not about blaming anyone or going into negative discussions. The goal is to improve, not to annoy people.

Make sure to reach out to introverts. Not everyone is comfortable speaking to groups, so use your means to involve them, by asking questions and putting them at ease; ignoring them is not a good idea. 

Keeping up positive language and stressing the fact we are doing this to learn from ourselves can help to create a better atmosphere. As suggested in the project evaluation document, getting the team to answer some questions ahead of time (using a survey) could also help people contribute. 

Make sure to keep to the time and be organized. Set a “schedule” for the retrospective to ensure it moves forward. Depending on the number of participants, the duration of the session can be around 1.5 or 2 hours. 

Make sure the action points are clear and achievable so that they can be done!

Stress also what worked well during the project. It is also good to reinforce what we do well to keep it for the next time. 

Tell the whole team what happened so we can all learn from the experience

##The classic retrospective... 

1. The introduction
Present the session. Welcome people, expose the subject and the objectives of the session so they are clear to everybody.  

2. Post-its: three things that went well, three things to improve
Provide the team two different colors of post-its. One for good things, another for things to improve. Tip: Having two different colors and freedom to fill as much as they can of each color will give you an idea of the mood. 
Give them markers to write. That way, they are able to write short sentences and we can write the post-its when they will be in the wall. 
Give them around 5 minutes to think and write their thoughts. 
After five minutes ask them to stop. 
Varianza: You can either limit the post-its to fill in or the time. But limit one of those because if you don’t, you will end up with too many post-its and no time to go over all of them. 
Varianza: If you don’t want to waste post-its you can make a trello board. But in this case we will need everybody to have a computer and a trello account. 

3. Presentation.
Where one by one, people share their ideas and stick the post-its in a wall. Now, one by one everybody will present their post-its and explain them if needed. Be sure everybody has the time to talk. 

4. Agreement. 
Where all the group discuss the ideas and agrees on point to improve or to keep for the next one. Potentially assign responsibilities to people. 

5. Conclusions. 
After the session, the facilitator and the project manager will summarize all the outcomes of the session and highlight the objectives. Share with the rest of the team. 

#Final Thoughts
As we said before, retrospectives can be run in many different ways, here you have some links for inspiration:

An idea to mix-up with feedback: http://toolbox.hyperisland.com/feedback-start-stop-continue

A couple of things we thought in our last retrospective (Half Earth):
- Make people ask themselves at least one thing they’ve learnt!
- Linked to this idea that everyone committed in the Kick-off meeting they were going to learn while working on this project, it would be nice to see the progress and let them talk about it.
- It would be nice to ask people to assess and express one thing they could have done better in this project that will probably be turned into a commitment for the next project they start working on.
