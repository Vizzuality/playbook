# Project Communication guidelines

## Communication with the Client

Broadly we could think of 4 main needs regarding the channels of communication with the client:

### Task Management System
Our recommendation for this is to use [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard). Ideally tasks should have meaningful tags/labels associated to them so that filtering by feature/priority/topic... is easier. Besides that they will normally be included in an epic.
We recommend that only one person from the client's side can create tasks -normally the Project Manager, while everyone else from their team should be able to add comments to the tasks. Internally everyone should be able to create tasks, although in many cases the person who would do this would be either the Project Manager or an "area manager" _(frontend, backend, UX, etc)_.
