# Vizzuality Ethos

The “Vizzuality Ethos” is the methodology of how we undertake our projects. Everything from the steps we go through to complete a project to the way we interact with the client, to how we work together in the project. The purpose of this methodology is two-fold. First, for new staff this should provide the knowledge required to understand how we do projects in Vizzuality. For existing staff this serves as a reference when you need guidance for a particular project. Some modules will help our team to explain the way we work to our clients.
